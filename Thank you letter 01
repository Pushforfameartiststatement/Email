Hi Pankaj, 

It's really nice to meet you. I have really great morning. 
Here is the information of people that I mentioned yesterday. 

Tiffany Chou 
tichou0823@gmail.com
She is a web, and app designer from last year in ITP. I think she might get higher chance to be available in this following month.

Another two I mention is: 
Youjin Shin (She was doing robot in South Korea before)
meggonagul@gmail.com
Sarah  Rothberg ( I think her idea is always good. Maybe you can talk to her)
sarahrothberg@gmail.com

Two of them are from my year.

I will be free after May. I will send you a email at that time. Maybe we can work at that time if you are still interesting in hiring me.
Thanks for your wonderful conversation, and have a good day.

Best,
Ting
