Hi Pankaj, 
It was really nice to meet you yesterday. Here are the contact details of the people I mentioned yesterday:
Tiffany Chou 
tichou0823@gmail.com
She is an alumni of ITP (2013), and she is a web and app designer. I think she is most likely to be available next month. 

Youjin Shin
meggonagul@gmail.com
She is in my year, and she worked on robots in South Korea before. 

Sarah  Rothberg
sarahrothberg@gmail.com
She is also in my year, and I think her ideas are always good so maybe you should have a chat with her. 

As for me, I won't be free until after May. I will drop you an email then, and I would love to work with you if you have any further opportunities for collaboration.

Thanks for the wonderful conversation, and have a good day.
Best,
Ting
